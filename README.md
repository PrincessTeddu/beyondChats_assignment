## 🧠 How It Works

1. The user submits a message.
2. The app:

   * Displays the message in the chat.
   * Checks for predefined keywords.
   * Responds with a smart reply if a match is found.
   * Falls back to a generic response otherwise.
3. Contextual suggestions are dynamically updated.
4. Clicking a suggestion auto-fills the input for easy sending.

This provides a smooth and guided experience for handling routine queries.
